PicOnMap flutter application

## Getting Started

Can't remember the location where you took a picture with your camera or smartphone? 
Upload your photos and find out where they were taken. 
PicOnMap analyzes EXIF data embedded in the image to find the GPS coordinates and location. 
The result would be a map view of your photo with detailed address and additional EXIF information if available.
